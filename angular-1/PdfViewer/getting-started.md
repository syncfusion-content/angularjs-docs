# Getting Started

The AngularJS directives are usually included within the `ej.widget.angular.min.js` file and all these directives are usually packed together in a common module known as `ejangular`. For basic details on how to configure Syncfusion widgets in AngularJS framework, refer [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/js/angularjs).

To get start with the PDF viewer control in AngularJS framework, the following list of external dependencies are mandatory which are available in the following link, 

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) - 1.7.1 and later versions
* [jsRender](https://github.com/borismoore/jsrender) - to render the templates
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

The external AngularJS script file `angular.min.js` can also be accessed from the following installed location.

* **(installed location)**\Syncfusion\Essential Studio\{{ site.releaseversion }}\JavaScript\assets\external

An another mandatory script is `ej.widget.angular.min.js`, which can be accessed from the below specified location.

* **(installed location)**\Syncfusion\Essential Studio\{{ site.releaseversion }}\JavaScript\assets\scripts\common

## Script/CSS Reference

Create a new HTML file and include the below initial code.

{% highlight html %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title> </title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>

{% endhighlight %}

Refer the CSS file from the specific theme folder to your HTML file within the head section as shown below. Please refer to our built-in theme [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/js/theming-in-essential-javascript-components).

{% highlight html %}

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Getting Started - PDF viewer</title>
    <link href="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/{{ site.releaseversion }}/js/web/flat-azure/ej.web.all.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

{% endhighlight %}

Refer the [CDN](https://help.syncfusion.com/js/cdn) script files with other required external dependencies.

{% highlight html %}

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Getting Started - PDF viewer</title>
    <link href="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/{{ site.releaseversion }}/js/web/flat-azure/ej.web.all.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/js/assets/external/jquery-3.0.0.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/js/assets/external/jsrender.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/js/assets/external/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/{{ site.releaseversion }}/js/web/ej.web.all.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/{{ site.releaseversion }}/js/common/ej.widget.angular.min.js"></script>
</head>

{% endhighlight %}

In the above code, `ej.web.all.min.js`script reference has been added for demonstration purpose. It is not recommended to use this for deployment purpose, as its file size is larger since it contains all the widgets. Instead, you can use[CSG](http://csg.syncfusion.com/# "") utility to generate a custom script file with the required widgets for deployment purpose.

## Initialize and configure the control

The ng-app directive explains the root element (<html> or <body> tags) of the application. You will assign a name to the ng-app directive, then you must create a module with that name. In this module, you will have to define your directives, services and configurations.

Once added the element you can initialize the control from the script section like below:


{% highlight html %}
 <div id="pdfviewer" style="width: 100%;height:680px" ej-pdfviewer e-serviceurl="serviceurl" e-isresponsive="true" ></div>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
angular.module('PDFViewerController', ['ejangular']).controller('PDFViewerController', function ($scope) {
    $scope.serviceurl = "http://js.syncfusion.com/ejservices/api/PdfViewer",
});
{% endhighlight %}

N> Default PDF document will be rendered, which is used in the online service.

Once you completed the above steps, you get an output like below,
