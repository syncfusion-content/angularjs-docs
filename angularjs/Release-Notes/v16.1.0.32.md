## ejSchedule

### Breaking changes
{:#ejschedule-breaking-changes}

* Revamped the timezone functionality to update the appointments in DB with zero UTC and also to fetch and render the appointments in proper duration. Regarding this, the existing users need to make two specific changes from their application end –
    a. Explicitly converting the start and end time of appointments to universal time before updating to database.
    b. Also, converting start and end time to local time during appointments fetch up from database and assigning to Schedule dataSource.
