### Bug Fixes

* \#165536 - Problem with an isolated scope concept, while using it with our custom directives is fixed.
* \#161980, #163381 - In AngularJS, when dynamically change the scope variable inside the EJ control's events then it automatically reflected in corresponding EJ controls, no need of trigger “$scope.apply()” manually.
